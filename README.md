Introduction: The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game where players must replicate a sequence of colors or sounds generated by the game.

HTML Structure: The HTML file defines the basic structure of the game. It includes elements for the game buttons, title, level display, and the reset/end screen.

CSS Styling: The CSS file styles the HTML elements, providing a visually appealing and responsive design. Certain elements are initially hidden or displayed as needed during different phases of the game.

JavaScript Functionality: The JavaScript code controls the game's logic and behavior. It initializes variables, sets up event listeners, and defines functions for gameplay.

Gameplay Flow: Clicking the "Start" button initiates the game, hiding unnecessary elements and displaying the game grid and level counter. The game generates a random sequence of colors, representing the order for the player to follow.

Flicker Animation: The FlickSequence function animates the flickering of the colored buttons in the sequence order.

Game State Handling: The Check function verifies if the player's sequence matches the generated sequence. If correct, the game progresses to the next level; otherwise, it triggers a wrong sequence response.

Wrong Sequence Response: The WrongStat function handles the scenario when the player makes a mistake, resetting the game and playing a sound effect.

Restart Feature: The "Restart" button allows the player to reset the game after completing or failing a level.

Audio Effects: Sound effects (bop and wrong) are triggered during gameplay to enhance the user experience.

Level Counter Display: The level counter dynamically updates to reflect the current level of the game.
